        <h1>General Terms of Service</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <p>These Terms of Service are important, so we hope you will read them and let us know if you have any questions. You can always e-mail us at info@swtchev.com if you do.
              By creating an account or accessing any services from Swtch E-Car Inc.
              (SWTCH or We) you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Service and conditions, as they may be updated by SWTCH from time to time at its sole discretion (Terms of Service).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="title">Service</div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>
          SWTCH provides a marketplace application and website as well as associated media and support (the Service) that helps its users (Hosts) enter into agreements with other users (Guests) to temporarily park and charge Guests' electric vehicles (EVs).
          We refer to Hosts and Guests collectively as Users. We call the service Hosts provide to Guests the Charge. Anyone who uses the Service, including both Hosts and Guests, is called a User. Any new features or tools that are added to the current Service will also be subject to these Terms of Service.
          You can review the current version of the Terms of Service at any time on the SWTCH website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Service is made available solely for your personal, noncommercial use.
            You acknowledge that SWTCH does not provide the Charge.
            SWTCH is not a party to any agreements entered into between Hosts and Guests, nor is SWTCH a landlord, a real estate broker, agent or insurer.
            SWTCH has no control over the conduct of Hosts and Guests and other Users of the Service or any accommodations, and disclaims all liability in this regard to the maximum extent permitted by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to create a listing on SWTCH, you understand and agree that your relationship with SWTCH is limited to being a User and an independent, third-party contractor and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of SWTCH for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of SWTCH. SWTCH does not control, and has no right to control, your listing, your offline activities associated with your listing, or any other matters relating to any listing, that you provide. As a User, you agree not to do anything to create a false impression that you are endorsed by, partnering with, or acting on behalf of or for the benefit of SWTCH, including by inappropriately using any intellectual property of SWTCH.
          </p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that, by accessing or using the Service or by using the SWTCH website(s), you are indicating that you have read, and that you understand and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, whether or not you have become a User. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, then you have no right to access or use the Service, including the SWTCH website(s).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you accept or agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms of Service and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.

       <div class="title">The Terms of Service</div>
       <div class="description">
         <p>
           SWTCH reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service by posting updates and changes to the SWTCH website. You are advised to check the Terms of Service from time-to-time for any updates or changes that may impact you. If we post an update about changes to the Terms of Service and you continue to use the Service, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms of Service.
           You must read, agree with and accept all of the Terms of Service and conditions contained in these Terms of Service and any referenced documents, including SWTCH’s Privacy Policy, before you may become a SWTCH user.
         </p>
         <p>
           Supplemental Terms of Service may apply to aspects of the Service. If we create supplemental Terms of Service we will disclose them to you and they will, unless otherwise noted, prevail over these Terms of Service in the event of a conflict.
         </p>
         <p>
           The Terms of Service may be available in languages other than English. To the extent of any inconsistencies or conflicts between these English Terms of Service and SWTCH’s Terms of Service available in another language, the most current English version of the Terms of Service will prevail.
         </p>
         <p>
           No term of these Terms of Service will be enforceable by any person that is not a party to it.
         </p>
         <p>
           You may not assign these Terms of Service without our written approval. SWTCH is entitled to assign or sub-contract our obligations under these Terms of Service without your consent. One example of when this could happen is if we get subcontractors to help us provide the Service, or if part or all of our company is bought or combined with another company.
         </p>
         <p>
           All parties to these Terms of Service shall be released from their respective obligations in the event of national emergency, war, prohibitive governmental regulation or if any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the parties or either of them renders the performance of these Terms of Service impossible, whereupon all money accrued due under these Terms of Service shall be paid
         </p>
         <p>
           Each party acknowledges that these Terms of Service (including any referenced agreements and policies) contain the whole agreement between the parties and that it has not relied upon any oral or written representations made to it by the other or its employees or agents and has made its own independent investigations into all matters relevant to it.         </p>
         <p>
           You agree that these Terms of Service are fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent possible.
           No delay, neglect or forbearance on the part of either party in enforcing against the other party any term or condition of these Terms of Service shall either be or be deemed to be a waiver or in any way prejudice any right of that party under these Terms of Service. No right, power or remedy in these Terms of Service conferred upon or reserved for either party is exclusive of any other right, power or remedy available to that party.
         </p>
         <p>
           Headings contained in these Terms of Service are for reference purposes only and should not be incorporated into these Terms of Service and shall not be deemed to be any indication of the meaning of the clauses to which they relate.

      <div class="title">The License</div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          You agree that, whether in your capacity as a Host or Guest, if you book through the Service, you appoint us as your agent for the purposes of forming a binding license between you and the other User involved in the transaction on the terms set out in these Terms of Service. The license lasts only as long as specified in the booking, and permits the Guest to park and obtain the Charge only. You appoint us to handle payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time we confirm the booking of the parking space and EV supply equipment in question and receive payment from the Guest, a binding agreement is formed between the Users, which agreement does not include SWTCH. The agreement is a license provided by the Host to the Guest to temporarily use and occupy the parking space and use the EV supply equipment specified in the booking for time set out in booking on the terms set out in these terms and conditions. The Guest is not a tenant of the Host and has not been granted exclusive possession of the parking space or any rights other than those specifically set out under these Terms of Service. Any use will be based on these standard Terms of Service and will only include any additional restrictions or rules relating to the Host's parking space if they are permitted by these Terms of Service and listed by the Host in its profile at the time the booking is made. The Guest is not obliged to accept any further terms once a booking has been confirmed.

      <div class="title">Local Laws and Legal Agreements with Third Parties</div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          We don't provide the Charge—you do. That's why you need to review the laws and any relevant legal agreements with third parties to make sure they don't legally prevent you from providing the Charge. We can't give you legal advice, but we suggest you consider local laws, municipal by-laws, your insurance policy and any third party agreements, included leases and agreements with utilities. We won't be liable if you provide the Charge in violation of local law or any agreements with third parties, or if providing the Charge causes negative legal consequences, such as invalidating your insurance.

      <div class="title">Disputes</div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The Terms of Service shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario with respect to any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with the Terms of Service. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms of Service and is hereby expressly excluded.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that SWTCH’s rights and your obligations to SWTCH are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm SWTCH and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone so that SWTCH shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligation of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief and agree to limit your claims to claims for money damages (if any).</br>
          Disputes will be resolved only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other claims, suits or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of these Terms of Service.
